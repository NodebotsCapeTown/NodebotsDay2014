NodebotsDay2014
===============

Welcome to International [Nodebots](http://nodebots.io) Day in Cape Town, the first Nodebots day on African soil.

This is event is part of a much larger [Nodebots](https://github.com/nodebots/nodebotsday) weekend with people across the globe hacking hardware using Javascript.

It's a day where software meets hardware, where Javascript meets Arduino, made possible by [Johnny-Five]().

AND there will be a [Nodecopter](nodecopter.com/hack) you can hack as well. Join the queue...
